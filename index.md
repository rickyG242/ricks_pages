# 👁️ I'm Rick | Futuristic STEM Innovator

Welcome, traveler of both silicon and soul!

I am **Rick**, a **mechatronics engineer**, who loves building all kinds of systems.

In a world driven by exponential computation and algorithmic determinism, I seek to reintroduce **intent**, **elegance**, and **conscious design** back into the machine. My work is the convergence of logic and logos, code and conscience.
