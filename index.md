# 👁️ Techno-Philosopher | Systems Architect of Human Futures

Welcome, traveler of both silicon and soul.

I am **Rithvik**, a **Techno-Philosopher**: one who engineers systems not merely to function—but to mean something.

In a world driven by exponential computation and algorithmic determinism, I seek to reintroduce **intent**, **ethics**, and **conscious design** back into the machine. My work is the convergence of logic and logos, code and conscience.
